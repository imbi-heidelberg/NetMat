# NetMat

The NetMat package is an extension of the BUGsnet package. As stated in
the BUGSnet packages: “BUGSnet (Bayesian inference Using Gibbs Sampling
to conduct NETwork meta-analysis) is a feature-rich R package to conduct
Bayesian network meta-analyses in compliance with best practice and
reporting guidelines. Bayesian analyses are conducted with JAGS, and
BUGS code is automatically generated by the package based on the user’s
inputs. Outputs are highly customizable and include network plots,
tables of network characteristics, league tables and league heat plots,
SUCRA plots, rankograms, forest plots, leverage plots, traceplots,
posterior mean deviance comparison plots.”

Additionally enrichment-through-weighting methods are included in the package to
conduct Bayesian network meta-analyses for targeted and non-targeted
studies along the lines of the analyses conducted by Proctor et. al. ().
